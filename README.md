Basic Coding Practice

This repository is a curated collection of coding problems solved in Python.
Problems are mainly from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and personal exploration.
The repository will continue to grow over time.

| Folder                   | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arrays**               | Problems focused on arrays/lists: indexing, two-pointers, sliding windows, etc.                                       |
| **String**               | String manipulation: substrings, palindromes, anagrams, parsing, etc.                                                 |
| **Hashing**              | Problems that rely primarily on hash maps/sets for optimal solutions (duplicates, frequency counting, grouping, etc.) |
| **Dynamic\_Programming** | Classic DP problems: optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems, solved via memoization or tabulation.             |
| **Linked\_List**         | Linked list problems: traversal, reversal, cycle detection, etc.                                                      |
| **Math**                 | Number theory, bitwise operations, integer operations (sqrt, power, primes, etc.).                                    |
| **Matrix**               | 2D array/grid-based problems: traversals, rotations, searching, etc.                                                  |
| **Patterns**             | Basic pattern printing, pyramids, shapesâ€”mostly logical/output formatting practice.                                   |


ðŸ“‚ Problem File Structure

Each problem file follows a consistent structure:

- Problem statement
- A short description of the task.
- At least one example with input/output.
- Functions/Approaches
- One or more functions implementing different approaches (brute force, hashing, optimal solution, etc.).
- Input section

Input is usually taken using input().

Functions are called and outputs are printed for testing.
