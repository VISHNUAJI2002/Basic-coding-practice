üêç Basic Coding Practice

This repository is a curated collection of coding problems solved in Python.
Problems are mainly from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and personal exploration.
The repository will continue to grow over time.

| Folder                     | Description                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arrays**                 | Problems focused on arrays/lists: indexing, two-pointers, sliding windows, etc.                                       |
| **String**                 | String manipulation: substrings, palindromes, anagrams, parsing, etc.                                                 |
| **Hashing**                | Problems that rely primarily on hash maps/sets for optimal solutions (duplicates, frequency counting, grouping, etc.) |
| **Dynamic_Programming**    | Classic DP problems: optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems, solved via memoization or tabulation.             |
| **Linked_List**            | Linked list problems: traversal, reversal, cycle detection, etc.                                                      |
| **Math**                   | Number theory, bitwise operations, integer operations (sqrt, power, primes, etc.).                                    |
| **Matrix**                 | 2D array/grid-based problems: traversals, rotations, searching, etc.                                                  |
| **Patterns**               | Basic pattern printing, pyramids, shapes‚Äîmostly logical/output formatting practice.                                   |
| **Recursion_Backtracking** | Recursive and backtracking-based problems: subsets, permutations, N-Queens, maze solving, etc.                        |


üìÇ Problem File Structure

Each problem file follows a consistent structure:

- Problem statement
- A short description of the task.
- At least one example with input/output.
- Functions (One or more functions implementing different approaches (brute force, hashing, optimal solution, etc.)).
- Input section
